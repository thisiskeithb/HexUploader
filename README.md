HexUploader
===========

Simple Mac app for loading hex onto Arduino boards. `AVRDUDE` is now integrated and the Adruino IDE is no longer required thanks to work by @nightflyer88.

Currently supports the following MCUs:
* ATmega1280
* ATmega2560
* Duemilanove / Nano - ATmega328p
* Duemilanove / Nano - ATmega168
* Uno - ATmega328p
* Pro mini - ATmega328p
